## 📘 Kia Stinger Overview

# Kia Stinger (2017–2023)

The Kia Stinger is a mid-size liftback (fastback) **sports sedan** from Kia, produced from 2017 through 2023. It was unveiled at the 2017 North American International Auto Show and launched for the 2018 model year. The Stinger was designed under Peter Schreyer (Kia’s Chief Design Officer) with input from Gregory Guillaume and engineered by ex–BMW M executive Albert Biermann. Its five-door “gran turismo” profile (long hood, sloping roofline) and hatchback cargo access underscore its performance intent and practicality.

* **Classification:** Mid-size sports sedan / grand tourer (Class D segment); 5-door liftback body.
* **Platform:** Shortened Hyundai Genesis front-engine, rear-wheel-drive (FMR) platform with added reinforcement. Optional rear-wheel steering (M4) added agility.
* **Production Timeline:** Production began Oct 2017 (2018 MY) and ended April 2023. Built at Kia’s Sohari Plant in South Korea (and under license in Russia/Kazakhstan).
* **Markets:** Sold globally (NA, Europe, Asia, etc.); U.S. market launch was 2019 model year. \~65,000 units sold in the U.S. by 2023.

## Powertrain & Performance

The Stinger offered two gasoline engines (plus a diesel in some markets) mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission (paddle-shifted) and RWD or optional AWD.

| Engine                                    | Power/Torque                   | 0–60 mph (approx.)    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| 2.0L turbocharged I4 (Theta)              | 255 hp @ 6,200 rpm / 260 lb-ft | \~6.0 s (RWD)         |
| 2.5L turbocharged I4 (Smartstream, 2021+) | 300 hp / 311 lb-ft             | \~5.6 s (RWD)         |
| 3.3L twin-turbo V6 (Lambda II)            | 365 hp / 376 lb-ft             | \~4.6–5.0 s (RWD/AWD) |
| 2.2L turbo-diesel I4 (CRDi, Euro)         | 199 hp / 325 lb-ft             | \~7.7 s (RWD)         |

* **2.0L Turbo I4:** 255 hp (European tune varies slightly) for base models. Moves the Stinger briskly; MotorWeek notes “still-potent” 255-hp output.
* **2.5L Turbo I4 (2021+):** Replaced 2.0L in later years; outputs \~300 hp (304 PS), with a 0–60 time around 5.6 s. Makes the base trim more powerful.
* **3.3L Twin-Turbo V6:** Offered in GT trims throughout. Produces \~365 hp and 376 lb-ft torque. Acceleration is strong (Kia claims 0–60 km/h \~4.9 s; Edmunds measured 0–60 mph ≈5.0 s).
* **Diesel (2.2L CRDi):** Available in Europe/Korea; \~199 hp and 325 lb-ft. Slower (Kia claims \~7.7 s 0–62 mph) but with high torque (441 Nm).
* **Drivetrain:** Default RWD; part-time or full-time AWD optional on all engines. The transmission is an 8-speed automatic (A8LR1/A8TR1) with Sport modes.
* **Performance:** The Stinger’s handling and braking are tuned for sporty driving. GT models have Brembo brakes and sport tires as standard. MotorTrend and MotorWeek praised its neutral chassis balance and strong grip on track.

## Chassis & Suspension

* **Layout:** Front-engine, rear- or all-wheel drive (4WD) sports sedan. Short front overhang, long wheelbase (114.4 in) for stability.
* **Suspension:** MacPherson strut front and multi-link rear (adaptive dampers standard on GT trims) provide a firm yet controlled ride. Drive modes adjust steering, throttle and damping.
* **Steering/Brakes:** Electric power steering, responsive with good feedback. GT trims have larger Brembo 4-piston front brakes for better stopping power.
* **Weight:** Curb weight varies \~3,600–3,900 lb (depending on configuration), making it heavier than some rivals but contributing to a planted feel.
* **Engineering:** Tuned by Albert Biermann (former BMW M); the result is a finely balanced chassis. MotorWeek highlighted its “finely-balanced, rear-drive chassis” under the Stinger’s fastback body.

## Design (Exterior & Interior)

* **Exterior Highlights:** The Stinger’s styling evokes classic GT coupes. Key elements: long hood, fastback roof, Coke-bottle flanks and quad exhaust tips. The grille mimics Kia’s “tiger nose,” flanked by swept-back LED headlights. A sleek rear hatch integrates a hidden lip spoiler.
* **Facelift (2020):** In 2020, the Stinger received revised bumpers, slimmer headlights/taillights, and new wheel designs. The interior gained a larger 10.25″ infotainment screen.
* **Interior:** Seating is sporty and comfortable. GT2 models feature Nappa leather (heated/ventilated front seats with bolsters) and optional suede headliner (in Tribute Edition). The dashboard has a driver-focused hooded gauge cluster and an available head-up display.
* **Space & Practicality:** Despite its sporty shape, the Stinger offers a roomy hatchback cargo area (\~23.3 cu ft). Rear seats (60/40 split-fold) fold down for extra space. Passengers enjoy ample legroom; headroom is decent up front but tighter in the rear due to the sloping roof.
* **Quality:** Critics found the cabin’s materials and finish upscale for the price, though some hard plastics and switchgear from other Kia models remain. Overall fit & finish was judged as generally high for the segment.

## Technology & Safety

* **Infotainment:** Standard touchscreen (7″ or 10.25″ on higher trims) with navigation. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration are standard. Available features include Bluetooth, premium Harman/Kardon audio (up to 15 speakers), and UVO eServices telematics.
* **Driver Aids:** A suite of Kia Drive Wise technologies was offered, especially on higher trims. These include:

  * **Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist** (autobraking with pedestrian/cyclist detection).
  * **Lane Keeping Assist / Departure Warning** (steering correction if drifting).
  * **Blind-Spot Collision Warning** with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert.
  * **Smart Cruise Control** (adaptive cruise with stop-and-go function).
  * **High Beam Assist, Driver Attention Warning**, and **parking sensors** (front/rear).
* **Safety:** Standard safety gear includes multiple airbags (front, side, curtain, driver’s knee), ABS, ESC, and traction control. The Stinger earned good crash-test scores; the 2023 model achieved top ratings in all IIHS crash tests (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety).
* **Features:** Other tech included keyless entry/start, dual-zone climate control, head-up display (on top trims), and available rear heated seats (GT2/AWD models).

## Market Reception & Reviews

* **Critical Acclaim:** Reviewers generally praised the Stinger as a serious sports sedan value. Edmunds said it “performs on a level well above our expectations for its modest price”. Car and Driver (long-term test) noted it “drives like a working man’s Panamera” – powerful and poised.
* **Driving Dynamics:** Testers highlighted its strong acceleration (especially with the V6) and sharp handling. Edmunds reported strong mid-range punch (“impressed by the thrust of the twin-turbo V6”). MotorTrend noted neutral turn-in and composed damping.
* **Interior/Practicality:** The spacious cargo area and cabin comfort were seen as strengths. Edmunds ranked its cargo space highest among similar sedans, and noted the high-quality interior materials.
* **Criticisms:** Some pointed out that despite performance, it lacked the prestige of German rivals. Fuel economy (especially with the V6/AWD) was middling (\~17–25 mpg combined). Rear headroom and visibility received minor complaints due to the sloping roof.
* **Sales:** The Stinger built a dedicated following but sales were never massive. By 2023, Kia had sold over 65,000 in the US. Declining sales, partly due to shifting market tastes and Kia’s EV focus, led to its early discontinuation.

## Awards & Industry Recognition

* **Design Awards:** 2018 EyesOn Design Award (Production Car) at Detroit Auto Show. 2018 Red Dot “Best of the Best” for product design. Also won iF Design Awards (2018) for its styling.
* **MotorWeek 2018:** Won *Drivers’ Choice Award* “Best Sport Sedan” and overall “Best of the Year”. Judges praised its style, power (255 hp I4, 365 hp V6), and handling.
* **Editorial Picks:** Named to *Edmunds*’ lists of Best AWD Sedans and Best Sport Sedans for 2018. In 2023, Money Magazine honored the Stinger as “Best Overall & Best Value” in the sports sedan category.
* **Legacy:** The Stinger is widely recognized for elevating Kia’s brand image into performance territory. Its engineering under Biermann paved the way for later performance models (e.g. EV6 GT).

## Discontinuation & Final Year

* **Final Model Year:** Kia announced 2023 as the Stinger’s last model year, ending production in spring 2023. (Final units were built early 2023.)
* **2023 Lineup:** Simplified to two trims – **GT-Line** (2.5L turbo I4, 300 hp) and **GT2** (3.3L turbo V6, 368 hp). AWD remained optional on both.
* **Special Editions:** Two 2023 special editions were offered: the *Apex Edition* (on GT-Line, with sport suspension and spoked wheels) and *Grand Tourer Edition* (on GT2, with premium interior touches).
* **Tribute Edition:** In late 2022 Kia introduced a 1000-unit *Stinger Tribute Edition* (2023 model) as a send-off. It featured exclusive colors (Ascot Green or Matte Gray), blacked-out trim, Brembo brakes, and unique interior (Terracotta Nappa leather, numbered sills). Only 440 of the Tributes were allocated to the U.S. market.
* **Context:** Kia positioned the Tribute Edition as an homage to the Stinger’s role in “pushing our high-performance vision”. The press release noted that learnings from Stinger influenced future models like the EV6 GT, winner of the 2023 World Performance Car award.
* **Aftermath:** With the Stinger gone, Kia’s focus has shifted toward SUVs, crossovers, and electrification. The Stinger’s discontinuation marked the end of Kia’s first large RWD sports sedan.
